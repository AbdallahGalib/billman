# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the WhatsApp Purchase Analyzer with advanced filtering, categorization, and improved transaction management capabilities. Users will be able to organize transactions into categories/groups, apply multi-dimensional filtering across the application, upload new transaction files, and view transactions in a hierarchical drill-down format for better data exploration and analysis.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Item Categorization System

**User Story:** As a user, I want to assign categories or groups to transaction items, so that I can organize and analyze my purchases by logical groupings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views a transaction THEN the system SHALL display a category field that can be edited
2. WHEN a user assigns a category to an item THEN the system SHALL automatically suggest the same category for future transactions with the same item name
3. WHEN a user creates a new category THEN the system SHALL add it to the available categories list
4. WHEN a user edits a category name THEN the system SHALL update all transactions using that category
5. IF a transaction item has no assigned category THEN the system SHALL display it as "Uncategorized"
6. WHEN a user deletes a category THEN the system SHALL prompt to reassign affected transactions to another category or mark as uncategorized

### Requirement 2: Multi-Dimensional Filtering System

**User Story:** As a user, I want to filter transactions and analytics by category, item, date range, and sender, so that I can analyze specific subsets of my purchase data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses any view with transactions THEN the system SHALL provide filter controls for category, item, date range, and sender
2. WHEN a user applies multiple filters THEN the system SHALL show transactions matching ALL selected criteria (AND logic)
3. WHEN filters are applied THEN the system SHALL update all charts, statistics, and transaction lists in real-time
4. WHEN a user clears filters THEN the system SHALL reset to show all transactions
5. WHEN filters are active THEN the system SHALL display a clear indication of active filters and their values
6. WHEN a user applies filters THEN the system SHALL persist filter state when navigating between views
7. IF no transactions match the filter criteria THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate "no results" message

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Dashboard Analytics Filtering

**User Story:** As a user, I want to filter dashboard analytics by group, item, and date range, so that I can focus my analysis on specific categories or time periods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is on the dashboard THEN the system SHALL provide prominent filter controls at the top of the analytics section
2. WHEN filters are applied to the dashboard THEN the system SHALL update all statistics cards, charts, and top items lists
3. WHEN a category filter is selected THEN the system SHALL show analytics only for transactions in that category
4. WHEN an item filter is selected THEN the system SHALL show analytics only for that specific item
5. WHEN a date range is selected THEN the system SHALL show analytics only for transactions within that period
6. WHEN multiple filters are combined THEN the system SHALL show analytics for the intersection of all criteria
7. WHEN filters are active THEN the system SHALL display the filtered data count and total amount prominently

### Requirement 4: Transaction File Upload Enhancement

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload new transaction files to add more data to my analysis, so that I can keep my transaction history up to date.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the upload section THEN the system SHALL provide a clear file upload interface
2. WHEN a user uploads a new transaction file THEN the system SHALL parse and validate the file format
3. WHEN new transactions are parsed THEN the system SHALL detect and highlight potential duplicates before importing
4. WHEN duplicate transactions are detected THEN the system SHALL allow the user to choose whether to import, skip, or merge duplicates
5. WHEN new transactions are imported THEN the system SHALL automatically suggest categories based on existing item-category mappings
6. WHEN the upload is complete THEN the system SHALL show a summary of imported transactions, errors, and category suggestions
7. IF the upload fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and suggestions for fixing the file format

### Requirement 5: Hierarchical Transaction View

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view transactions in a collapsible drill-down format, so that I can see summaries first and expand to view details on demand.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the transactions list THEN the system SHALL display transactions grouped by a selectable criteria (category, item, sender, or date)
2. WHEN transactions are grouped THEN the system SHALL show summary information for each group (count, total amount, date range)
3. WHEN a user clicks on a group header THEN the system SHALL expand to show individual transactions within that group
4. WHEN a group is expanded THEN the system SHALL allow collapsing it to return to summary view
5. WHEN viewing grouped transactions THEN the system SHALL provide controls to expand all or collapse all groups
6. WHEN a user changes the grouping criteria THEN the system SHALL reorganize the display accordingly
7. WHEN groups are displayed THEN the system SHALL sort them by total amount (highest first) by default with option to change sort order
8. WHEN individual transactions are shown THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing edit and delete functionality

### Requirement 6: Advanced Filter Persistence and Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want my filter selections to be remembered and manageable, so that I can quickly return to frequently used filter combinations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user applies filters THEN the system SHALL save the filter state in browser storage
2. WHEN a user returns to the application THEN the system SHALL restore the last used filter settings
3. WHEN a user creates a useful filter combination THEN the system SHALL allow saving it as a named filter preset
4. WHEN filter presets exist THEN the system SHALL provide a dropdown to quickly apply saved filter combinations
5. WHEN a user no longer needs a filter preset THEN the system SHALL allow deleting it
6. WHEN filters are applied THEN the system SHALL update the browser URL to reflect the current filter state for bookmarking
7. WHEN a user shares a filtered URL THEN the system SHALL apply those filters when the URL is accessed

### Requirement 7: Enhanced Analytics with Category Insights

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see analytics broken down by categories, so that I can understand my spending patterns across different types of purchases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views analytics THEN the system SHALL include category-based charts and statistics
2. WHEN category analytics are displayed THEN the system SHALL show spending by category in pie charts and bar charts
3. WHEN viewing category trends THEN the system SHALL show spending trends over time for each category
4. WHEN comparing categories THEN the system SHALL highlight the highest and lowest spending categories
5. WHEN a category is selected in analytics THEN the system SHALL allow drilling down to see items within that category
6. WHEN viewing category analytics THEN the system SHALL show average transaction amount per category
7. WHEN categories have no transactions THEN the system SHALL exclude them from analytics displays

### Requirement 8: Improved Data Export with Filtering

**User Story:** As a user, I want to export filtered data, so that I can share or analyze specific subsets of my transaction data in external tools.
